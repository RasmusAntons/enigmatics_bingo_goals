# Enigmatics Bingo Goals

Alternative goals for [Bingo](https://modrinth.com/mod/bingo-mod), specifically for lockout mode. This mod works server-side only and requires the Bingo mod to be installed.

The goals are intended to be played with a [player tracker](https://modrinth.com/mod/playertracker/) and require a [patch to allow never-type goals in lockout mode](https://github.com/Gaming32/bingo/pull/13).
